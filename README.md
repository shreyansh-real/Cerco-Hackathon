# Cerco-Hackathon

Cerco is a user-centric service discovery website that solves the problem of finding reliable local service providers in one place. It brings multiple everyday services—such as cleaning, plumbing, tutoring, and repairs—onto a single, easy-to-use platform.

The website helps users quickly search, explore, compare, and connect with service providers using a clean interface, clear categories, and transparent information like ratings, availability, and pricing. By reducing the time, confusion, and trust issues involved in offline searches or scattered platforms, Cerco offers a simple, accessible, and efficient digital solution for discovering trusted local services.
